# Introduction

The final project will use all of the information you have learned in this course to create a report on a network. For the final project, you will use data from the Phoenix Open Data Portal. Specifically, you will use co-arrest data. These data represent incidents where individuals were arrested together. For the final project, imagine that you work for a police department and your supervisor has asked you to create a report on co-offending networks. Your supervisor has provided you two networks: the `phx_arrest_2024_net` network of co-offending for 2024 and the `phx_arrest_2023_net` network of co-offending for 2023.

<br>

## Data

Both networks are available in the `SNACpack` package we have used throughout the course. Use `library( SNACpack )` to load the package, then `?phx_arrest_2024_net` and `?phx_arrest_2023_net` to review the documentation for each network. Be sure to review the documentation as it contains important information about the structure of the network as well as the vertex attributes.

<br>

## Template and Report Format

As with the labs, there is a template for the final project. The template is set up as a report in that the code chunks include the option `echo = FALSE`. What this does is hides the code in the final report. When you render your report, the code will be hidden so that it reads cleanly.

**IMPORTANT**: Do you report entire matrices or objects. These print out very long and are cumbersome to look through.

<br>

# Your Task

## Part I: Two-Mode Network

*What can you tell me about this network and what does it tell me about co-offending?* To answer your supervisor's question, provide an analysis of the `phx_arrest_2024_net` network. This analysis should include a visualization (or more) of the network as well as a description of the structural properties. In your analysis, you should identify what measures of network structure you are using and explain why you have selected the measure (or measures).

<br>

## Part II: One-Mode Network

*How is this network different from Part I and what does it tell me about co-offending?* To answer your supervisor's question, provide an analysis of the "person" matrix for the `phx_arrest_2024_net` network. Create an object of class `matrix` using the `as.sociomatrix()` function in the `network` package. In your analysis, you should identify what measures of network structure you are using and explain why you have selected the measure (or measures). 

<br>

## Part III: Comparison

*How has the co-offending network changed from 2023 to 2024?* To answer your supervisor's question, provide a comparative analysis of the `phx_arrest_2023_net` and the `phx_arrest_2024_net` networks. Think about the ways we discussed for comparing networks this semester. Your analysis should compare the two-mode networks as well as the "person" matrices. 

<br>

## Part IV: Executive Summary

This section should provide, in your own words, a summary of Parts I-III. This section should be targeted to a reader of the report who may not be familiar with network analysis, but wants to know what is going on with co-offending in Phoenix. Here are some interpretation prompts to help you with that section (though, you can don't *have* to use these):

  * What does this network suggest about the organization or fragmentation of co-offending in each year?
  
  * What story do these networks tell about how co-offending operates and evolves?
  
  * If you were briefing a supervisor or policy team, what are the three key takeaways from your analysis?
  
  * What are some limitations of your analysis? What data or methods would help improve your conclusions?
  
  * What surprised you the most during this projectâ€”and what might that mean?

# How to Submit

Download the [template for this final project](../labs/templates/final-project-LastName.zip?raw=true) prior to beginning the final project. 

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link for this assignment on the Canvas page for this course.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Final-Project-LastName.rmd** and **Final-Project-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
