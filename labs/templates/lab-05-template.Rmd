## Part III: Your Network

For this part of the lab, I would like you to construct a bipartite network. Think about a type of relationship that is interesting, important, etc. and what it connects. It can be a real example from your life, something fictitious, anything really. The *only* restriction is that it should have <u>at least</u> 25 nodes total (e.g., you could have 15 nodes in the first mode and 10 nodes in the second mode). We will be using this network in the next lab, so please be thoughtful in putting your network together.

After creating your bipartite network, do the following:

### 1. Create an adjacency matrix of the network using the `matrix()` function.

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 2. Create an object of class `network`. 

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 3. Plot the network using the `gplot()` function.

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 4. Calculate the density of the network.

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 5. Calculate the degree centrality scores for each set of nodes.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 6. Calculate the mean degree centrality scores.

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 7. Calculate the mean standardized degree centrality score.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 8. Plot the network using the standardized degree centrality scores. 

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

### 9. Based on the plot, what would you say about the structure of your network?

## *Challenge Question*

Feeling bold? Try this challenge question. It is not required, but try taking a crack at it.

*  Here is an edgelist for a small 8-node two-mode network:  
    * Percy - C1
    * Percy - C2
    * Percy - C3
    * Harry - C1
    * Harry - C2
    * Isildur - C1
    * Isildur - C2
    * Parker - C2
    * Parker - C3
    * Igor - C3

## Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link for this assignment on the Canvas page for this course.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
