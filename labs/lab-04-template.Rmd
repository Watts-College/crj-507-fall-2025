# Getting Started

## Setup

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# clear the workspace
rm( list = ls() )

```

<br>

### Part I

<br>

First, let's read in the `LondonGangNet` network that is stored as an .rds document in the data folder on the [Social Network Analysis for Crime Analysts using R](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-r/) textbook's [data page](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/tree/main/data). We will use the `readRDS()` function, with the [file path](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/raw/main/data/data-london-gang-net.rds), to load the file. Since we are calling a url, we need to use the `url()` function as well.  

Finally, we need to make sure the `sna` and `network` packages are loaded, using `library()`, so that R recognizes the `LondonGangNet` object as one of class `network`.

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# load the libraries we need
library( sna )
library( network )

# define the path location for the file
loc <- "https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/raw/main/data/data-london-gang-net.rds"
LondonGangNet <- readRDS( url( loc ) )

# look at the network
LondonGangNet

```

<br>

#### 1. Calculate and report the degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  

<br>

```{r}

# your code here

```

<br>

#### 2. Calculate and report the standardized degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 3. Calculate and report the mean (unstandardized) degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores.

```{r}

# use the mean() function to calculate the means

# Your code here
 
```

<br>

#### 4. Interpret each mean centrality score.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

<br>

#### 5. Calculate the graph centralization scores for degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 6. Interpret each graph centralization score.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

<br>

#### 7. Plot the network three times using the `gplot()` function where each plot sizes the nodes by the centrality score (i.e. a plot for degree centrality, a plot for closeness centrality, and a plot for betweenness centrality).

Be sure to use the `rescale()` function below in the `vertex.cex=` argument to appropriately size the nodes.

```{r}

# for sizing the nodes
rescale <- function( nchar, low, high ){
  min_d <- min( nchar )
  max_d <- max( nchar )
  rscl  <- ( ( high - low )*( nchar - min_d ) ) / ( max_d - min_d ) + low
  rscl
}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 8. Examine the plots. Describe how the differences you noted between the centrality measures above are seen in the plots.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

### Part II

<br>

Now, let's read in the `CocaineDealingNet` network that is stored as an .rds document in the data folder on the [Social Network Analysis for Crime Analysts using R](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-r/) textbook's [data page](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/tree/main/data). We will use the `readRDS()` function, with the [file path](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/raw/main/data/data-cocaine-dealing-net.rds), to load the file. Since we are calling a url, we need to use the `url()` function as well.  

Above, we needed to make sure the `sna` and `network` packages were loaded, but we loaded them above so we do not need to repeat the step here.

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

# define the path location for the file
loc2 <- "https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/snaca-r/raw/main/data/data-cocaine-dealing-net.rds"
CocaineDealingNet <- readRDS( url( loc2 ) )

# look at the network
CocaineDealingNet

```

<br>

#### 1. Calculate and report the indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  
  
```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 2. Calculate and report the standardized indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 3. Calculate and report the mean (unstandardized) indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores.

```{r}

# use the mean() function to calculate the means

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 4. Interpret each mean centrality score.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

<br>

#### 5. Calculate the graph centralization scores for indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.  

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 6. Interpret each graph centralization score.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

<br>

#### 7. Plot the network four times using the `gplot()` function where each plot sizes the nodes by the centrality score (i.e. a plot for indegree centrality, a plot for outdegree centrality, a plot for closeness centrality, and a plot for betweenness centrality).

<br>

```{r}

# Your code here

```

<br>

#### 8. Examine the plots. Describe how the differences you noted between the centrality measures above are seen in the plots.

add your interpretation here (THEN DELETE THIS STATEMENT)

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your homework, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate assignment on the Canvas page for this course. Just click the "Start Assignment" button to upload the files. This assignment is *DUE* on **2/21**.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Hmwk-##-LastName.rmd** and **Hmwk-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
